## Text (if self-post)
SnapForge is a simple screenshot API. Send a URL, get back an image.

I built this because I needed URL-to-image conversion for several projects and found existing solutions overpriced for what they offer.

Stack: Playwright + Chromium on Vercel serverless. No third-party rendering services.

Features: PNG/JPEG/PDF, full-page, dark mode, element selectors, ad blocking.

Free tier: 100 screenshots/month. Paid starts at $17/mo for 1K.

API: https://screenshot-api-two-omega.vercel.app/health
