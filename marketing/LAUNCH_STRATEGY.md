## Show HN Title Options

```
Show HN: SnapForge – Screenshot API that replaces your Puppeteer cluster
Show HN: SnapForge – URL to screenshot API with free tier, no signup
Show HN: SnapForge – I got tired of managing headless Chrome, so I built this
```

Rules: No superlatives, talk like an engineer, write detailed first comment,
post Tue-Thu 8-10 AM ET, have live demo working.

## Reddit Strategy

Best subreddits: r/SideProject (500K, welcomes launches), r/webdev (3.1M),
r/SaaS (100K), r/indiehackers (100K), r/Entrepreneur (4.8M).

Post Tue-Thu 9-11 AM EST. Respond to every comment.

r/InternetIsBeautiful (17M) requires: no signup forms, no pricing visible,
10+ karma, 90:10 contribution ratio. Need a free demo page.

## SEO Keywords

Primary: screenshot API, website screenshot API, url to screenshot API,
url to image API, html to image API

Long-tail: puppeteer screenshot alternative, generate og image from url,
how to take website screenshots programmatically, screenshot as a service

## Competitive Positioning

At $17/mo starter, between budget (CaptureKit $7, ApiFlash $9) and
premium (ScreenshotOne $29, Urlbox $29).

Angles:
- "The developer-first screenshot API" — DX focus
- "Generous free tier + no signup friction" — HN/Reddit love
- "Puppeteer without the infrastructure" — pain-point positioning

## Product Hunt Prep (4-6 weeks lead)

- Maker profile with real photo + activity
- Find a Hunter
- Build email list (20-50 early supporters)
- Assets: 3+ gallery images, 60-90s demo video/GIF
- Tagline (max 60 chars): "Screenshot API. One call. Any URL. Done."
- Launch at 12:01 AM Pacific, first 4 hours critical
